1. What vector do you need to create, and what does that look like? (see page 7 of the LMS lesson)

The vector for this problem is the collection of weights of the ice spheres.

It looks like: sph.weight.grams <- c(0.96,1.51,2.17,3.85,4.45,6.02)

2. What function do you need to create, and what does that look like? (see page 6 of the LMS lesson. Copy that pattern used to create the function(TF) to create your function(diam), and make sure you follow the PEMDAS rule!)

The function to be created is diam.

It looks like: diam <- function(Width) {
  (2 / 2.54 * ((Width / (0.92 * (4/3) * pi))) ^ (1/3))

3. What for loop do you need to create, and what does that look like? 
The for loop is: 
for computing the diameter 
in these different weights, 
do print the weight and the corresponding diameter.

It looks like:
for (g in sph.weight.grams) {
  c <-diam(g)
  cat ("For a weight of", g,"grams, the diameter of the ice sphere is",c,"inches.", "\n")
}
