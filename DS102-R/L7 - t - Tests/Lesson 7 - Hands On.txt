New Hampshire Average Annual Temperatures 

There is a great deal of discussion around average daily temperatures and subsequently,
average annual temperatures, when we consider the effects of global warming.

For this test, we simply want to know whether or not the first 25 years is
statistically significantly different from the last 25 years in the total of 59 years of 
total average daily temperatures.

This should be a dependent t-test.

The hypotheses are:
The difference between the first 25 years and the last 25 years is 0.
The difference between the first 25 years and the last 25 years is not equal to 0.

From our results:

	Paired t-test

data:  nhtemp[first25] and nhtemp[last25]
t = 2.094, df = 24, p-value = 0.047
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 0.005401357 0.746598643
sample estimates:
mean of the differences 
                  0.376 

The third line verifies that the alternative hypothesis is that the difference in the 
population means is not equal to zero, or equivalently that the two population means 
are not equal to each other. The p-value is notoriously close to .05, however, it is
smaller than .05, so we reject the null hypothesis.

Edited to include Emily's comments:
Layman's terms. Ex. "There was a significance between the temps from the first 25 years
compared to the last 25 years."
