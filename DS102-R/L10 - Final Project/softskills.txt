We may have proficiency in a particular skill but we rarely work entirely alone. 
Soft skills are what allow us to work together with others in a way that is 
efficient and with attention to our interactions with fellow team members.

My strongest soft skill is interpersonal communication. I believe it will by far
set me apart from other candidates.
